The format is SYMBOL (LIGATURE) = LAYER NAME

Ꜳ (AA) = Points

Ꜵ (AO) = Reincarnation/Rebirth. Each reincarnation gives 1 Ꜳ per click

Ꜷ (AU) = Energy. Each energy = PPS * (Energy^2), costs 15 sextillion.

Next after Energy, is Infinity value (= 1.8x10^308), or Dark Energy (I'll choose AV for costing 10^10^115 points)
